# Project Overview

The Sampoerna University Career Portal is a professional web application designed to centralize and streamline the connection between students and career opportunities. It addresses the current inefficiency of scattered job postings via emails and group chats, providing a modern, searchable, and organized platform.

# The Problem

Students currently miss out on valuable job and internship opportunities due to disorganized, hard-to-search information spread across various group chats and emails.

# The Solution

A unified, role-based web dashboard allowing:

- Students to easily search, filter, save, and apply for opportunities.

- Admins (Career Center) to post, edit, and manage all job listings from a secure interface.
